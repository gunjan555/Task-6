# KNN Classification Task

## Objective
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Iris dataset to classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Steps
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
- Normalized features using StandardScaler.
- Trained KNN models for multiple K values.
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualized accuracy vs K.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## Results
- Best K found: (from your output above)
- Accuracy achieved: (from your output above)

## How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell in order.
3. View model accuracy and confusion matrix.
